# How to set up as Bot

On GitHub, the autocomplete feature for usernames and bot names in comments is tied to actual GitHub user or bot accounts. If you want `@SeineSailor` to be recognized as a bot, you would need to create a GitHub App or a bot account associated with that name. Here’s how you can do that:

### Creating a GitHub App

1. **Create the GitHub App**:
   - Go to your GitHub settings or the organization settings if you want the app to be available organization-wide.
   - Navigate to **Developer settings** > **GitHub Apps** > **New GitHub App**.
   - Fill in the necessary details like GitHub App name, homepage URL (can be your project repository), and webhook information if you plan to use webhooks.
   - Set the necessary permissions your app will need, such as issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.
   - Optionally, enable the app to be installed on your account or any organization.

2. **Install the GitHub App**:
   - Once the GitHub App is created, you need to install it on your repository. Go to the GitHub App settings and select **Install App**.
   - Choose the repositories where you want this app to be active.

### Creating a Bot Account

Alternatively, you can create a regular GitHub user account which will act as a bot. Here’s how:

1. **Create a New GitHub Account**:
   - Sign up for a new GitHub account using a different email than your main account. This account will represent your bot.
   - Choose a username that matches your bot’s intended name, like `SeineSailor`.

2. **Configure Access**:
   - Add the bot account as a collaborator to your repository if it's a private repo, or simply start using it in public repositories.
   - Configure necessary access tokens or SSH keys that your bot might need to interact with your repository programmatically.

3. **Use the Bot Account in Actions**:
   - You can use this bot account to perform actions by using a personal access token generated by the bot account in your workflows. Ensure you handle these tokens securely.

### Using the Bot or App in Comments

Whether you created a GitHub App or a bot account, you can refer to it in issues, pull requests, or comments. Users will be able to @mention the bot account like any other user. If you set up a GitHub App, make sure its actions in issues and PRs are linked to a specific bot user.

### Best Practices

- **Security**: When creating a bot account, secure its access. Limit the repositories it has access to and regularly review its access rights.
- **Transparency**: Clearly document the bot’s purpose, what it does, and how it interacts within your projects to ensure contributors understand its function.

Creating a GitHub App is generally more powerful for automation and integration purposes and provides more control and security than a bot account, but it also requires more setup and maintenance. Choose the approach that best fits your project’s needs.


### Steps to Release a GitHub App to the GitHub Marketplace:

1. **Develop Your GitHub App**:
   - First, you must create a GitHub App as discussed previously. This involves setting the correct permissions, webhooks, and potentially a server to handle requests if your app is interactive or responds to GitHub events.

2. **Configure Your GitHub App for Marketplace**:
   - You need to configure your GitHub App with specific settings that make it suitable for the Marketplace. This includes setting up a pricing model (free, flat rate, per-unit), providing detailed descriptions, logos, and screenshots for your app.

3. **Comply with GitHub Marketplace Requirements**:
   - GitHub has [specific requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/github-marketplace) for apps listed on its Marketplace. These include:
     - Security best practices.
     - Providing support for users of the app.
     - Demonstrating a high level of performance and reliability.
     - Having clear and detailed documentation.
     - Implementing a proper onboarding and offboarding process for users.

4. **Submit Your App for Review**:
   - Once your app meets all the requirements and is fully tested, you can submit it for review by GitHub. This process will check if your app complies with all guidelines and requirements.
   - The review process also ensures that your app does not violate any of GitHub's terms of service and that it provides value to potential users.

5. **Publish and Manage Your App on GitHub Marketplace**:
   - After approval, you can publish your app on the GitHub Marketplace.
   - You will need to manage your app by updating it regularly, responding to user feedback, handling support requests, and potentially handling billing issues if your app is not free.

### Advantages of Listing on GitHub Marketplace

- **Visibility**: Your app gains more visibility as it is accessible to a large number of GitHub users.
- **Trust**: Being on the official GitHub Marketplace can lend credibility and trustworthiness to your app.
- **Monetization**: You have the option to monetize your app directly through GitHub’s billing system.

### Considerations

- **Maintenance**: Running a GitHub App that is listed on the Marketplace requires ongoing maintenance and customer support.
- **Costs**: Depending on your app’s architecture, you might incur running costs (e.g., servers, databases). If your app is free, these are costs you’ll need to absorb.
- **Compliance and Security**: You must ensure your app remains secure and compliant with GitHub’s standards, which may require regular audits and updates.

Publishing on the GitHub Marketplace is a significant step that can expand your app's reach and utility. It's ideal if you believe your app provides value that other developers or companies would benefit from and are prepared to handle the responsibilities that come with managing a publicly available tool.

### Browser-Extension Idea

Creating a "floating" chat window for GitHub is an innovative idea and definitely feasible with some web development and integration work. Here’s a high-level approach on how you could achieve this:

1. **Browser Extension**: Develop a browser extension that injects a chat window into GitHub's web interface. This would allow the chat window to "float" and be accessible while you browse different parts of GitHub.

2. **Accessing GitHub Context**: To make the chatbot context-aware (e.g., understanding if you're on an issue or a pull request page), the browser extension can read the URL or DOM (Document Object Model) to determine the page context. Additionally, it can use GitHub's API to fetch more detailed data about the current page, such as issue content, pull request details, etc.

3. **Backend for Chatbot**: Implement a backend server where the actual chatbot logic runs. This server would handle requests from the browser extension and process them accordingly. For context-aware capabilities, the server would use GitHub API tokens provided by the user to fetch necessary data.

4. **Communication**: The browser extension would communicate with your backend using WebSocket or RESTful APIs. This setup allows real-time interaction between the user and the chatbot.

5. **Authentication and Security**: Ensure the system securely handles GitHub tokens and user data. Using OAuth for token management and HTTPS for data transmission is recommended.

6. **User Interface**: Design a minimal and non-intrusive chat interface that can be easily accessed on GitHub pages without disrupting the user workflow. Consider features like expand/collapse, drag to reposition, and customization options for appearance.

7. **Testing and Compatibility**: Test the extension across different browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and ensure it works seamlessly with various GitHub features and during updates to GitHub’s UI.

This project involves a mix of web development (for the browser extension), backend development (for handling logic and API integrations), and a good understanding of user experience design. If you’re considering building this, you might start by developing a basic prototype that can be iteratively improved based on user feedback.
